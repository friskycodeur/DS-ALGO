# Stack

### Basic Operations :

- Push() = This operation inserts a value on the top of a stack.
- Pop() = This operation delets the topmost value of the stack.
- top() = This operation returns the topmost value of the stack.
- empty() = It returns if the given stack is empty or not.

### Basics of Stack

- In the starting the top = -1
- When we insert at top of stack , first the top is incremented by 1 , i.e. top++ and then the value is added at that index.
- When we pop , then top-- happens , the value doesn't go anywhere but in the stack we have no way to go to that value.
- If top =-1 then stack is empty or else it is not.
